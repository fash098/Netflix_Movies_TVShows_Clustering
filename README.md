# Netflix_Movies_TVShows_Clustering


This dataset consists of tv shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019. The dataset is collected from Flixable which is a third - party Netflix search engine. In 2018, they released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled.

Integrating this dataset with other external datasets such as IMBD ratings, rotten tomatoes can also provide many interesting findings.

In this project, we will :

A) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis

B) Understand the types of contents available in different countries

C) See if Netflix has been increasingly focusing on TV rather than movies in recent years

D) Cluster similar content by matching text based features
